Paper Abstract: In the decades since its conception, intersectionality scholarship has grown to span a range of topics, study populations, disciplines, and methodologies. It has also become a literature mired in fierce contention. Efforts to expand intersectionality to quantitative research and new study populations have resulted in an increasing focus on identity over structural analysis and move away from Black women as central subjects of study. A contingent of scholars has criticized these transitions, but largely on theoretical grounds. In this study, I push forward those scholars’ arguments while offering a quantitative research design that operationalizes structure and recenters Black women. Specifically, I explore the question: How do Black mothers and their families in the U.S. experience compounded deprivation? To answer this question, I employ multidomain sequence analysis as a novel method to approximate and analyze multiple structures—the carceral system, housing, and social networks—and demonstrate how they configure to entangle Black women in persistent hardship. In so doing, I offer an approach to documenting hardships in a way that more closely reflects Black women’s unique lived experiences of deprivation.
